## Vision

Statistics show that only about 30% of eligible voters cast a ballot in local elections.
There are also disparities in the age, racial, and income makeup of voters in local elections. The average age of a voter in a local election is around 65. Voters who are white and affluent also vote at higher levels. This skews local government to better reflect the interests of these demographics.

With CitizenHero we hope to engage more people in their local politics and provide them with a more convenient and more fun way to participate and shape their neighbourhoods.
